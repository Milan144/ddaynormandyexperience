    subtitle:
      "Living a unique experience with your guide through the centuries",
    overview: `In the year 708, the town of Avranches, which is very close to the Mont, was ruled by a bishop named Aubert. One night, Aubert saw the Archangel Saint-Michel in a dream. The Archangel gave him the order to build a place of worship in his honour on the mount lost in shifting sand. Aubert did nothing about it, thinking his imagination had got the better of him.

The Archangel grew impatient with him, and when he appeared the third time, he poked a
hole in Aubert’s skull to make him believe him. Aubert began to construct the sanctuary in the shape of a cave which could receive hundreds of pilgrims.

Discovering this history of Mont Saint Michel during an exceptional day : history,
architecture, culture, art and living an original experience ! Let yourself tell the story of the origins of Mont Saint-Michel ! Get out of time in a unique location. Get carried away from any temporality in a unique place with local and magic stories and a musical tour.`,
